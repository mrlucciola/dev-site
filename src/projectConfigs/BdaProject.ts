Beat Detection Algorithm is, as the name describes, a simple beat detection algorithm presented through a React frontend.
The app inputs audio files (mp3/mp4) sampled at 44.1kHz, performs analysis, and outputs a tempo measured in beats-per-minute (BPM).
Fast Fourier transforms are used to decompose the samples from time-domain into frequency-domain, allowing us to isolate the low frequencies.
Low frequencies are the typical range for the rhythmic components of a song, and we can (crudely) estimate the BPM for a given song by identifying the average time between peaks in the low end.

Once the low-frequency peaks are isolated from the audio file, the audio is transformed back into the time-domain - where we can measure the time between each peak and calculate a mean, leaving us with the BPM.

Songs are pulled from soundcloud, but due to CORS issues, you must disable CORS in your browser to use this app properly.
